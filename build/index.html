        <h1 id="authoring-a-devnet-api-reference-manual">Authoring a DevNet API Reference Manual</h1>

<p>DevNet is Cisco&rsquo;s Developer Program aimed a helping developers gain access to Cisco Technology such that they can build cool and exciting products.  Wether a developer is an IT Professional working inside of a Cisco Customer&rsquo;s IT organization, a System Integrator, or a developer at an Independent Software Developer Program, Cisco DevNet is there to help make your professional life easier.</p>

<p>Cisco has hundreds of product API&rsquo;s for developers.  We want to make it easy for you to find the API that you need to get your job done but we also want to make it easy
for you to use the API of choice.  To do this, we are providing a standard format for the documentation of API&rsquo;s with Cisco.</p>

<p>This document describes how an engineer or tech writer within Cisco would write an API reference manual for publication on DevNet.  The toolchain that we are using is based upon Slate, the open source tool from TripIt, which in turn was inspired by the API Reference Manual published by Stripe.  Like many developers, we love the simple, elegant, yet powerful way that Stripe documented their API.  In particular we loved how within the context of any given API call, you can choose a language and see sample code - we knew that we were not alone and thus we chose to model our own documentation on this style.</p>

<p>Overtime, we have ideas on how we can update and modify this format to better suit the needs of the developer community and we are already planning those changes.  But for now, we have this initial version.</p>

<h1 id="how-devnet-slate-works">How DevNet Slate Works</h1>

<p>Cisco&rsquo;s implementation of Slate is an HTML document generator that is written and executed in Ruby.  The software reads a source-file in Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is used to generate an HTML API Reference Manual along with the accompanying Javascript and CSS files.  The Javascript and CSS files are simply included into the HTML that is generated from the GFM File.</p>

<p>It all sounds simple, but it is a bit more complicated than that.  To get a consistent look and feel to Cisco API documentation, we want the authors of API Reference Manuals to use the GFM tags in a particular way such that we get a common and consistent look and feel to Cisco API documents.  It is important to achieve this cross-product consistency for if a developer gets trained and used to on Cisco API Reference manual but now needs to use an API from another business unit, we want to leverage their experience and make the cross training experience simple and pleasant.</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-a-devnet-slate-document">Structure of a DevNet Slate Document</h2>

<p>As you look at this document, you will notice that there are a couple of feature.  First, to the left is the Table of Contents area.  Next, in the center is the Body of the document, and to the Right (in the dark area) are code examples.  Each of these elements have the following characteristics:</p>

<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>

<p>The TOC panel on the left hand side of the panel is composed of the following elements starting at the top and moving to the bottom:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search Box - If search is enabled, a Search Box will appear above the Table of Contents.  The Search Box is used to search the document looking for phrases of interest.  The phrases are then highlighted in the Table of Contents.</li>
<li>The Table of Contents - The Table of Contents are automatically built if the feature has been turned on.  By default, on the H1 is normally displayed.  If a user selects a H1 item, the TOC will expand to display the H2 items underneath it.  If the user selects a H2 item, the TOC will expand to display the H3 items underneath it.  Directives are used to control the table of contents.</li>
<li>The TOC Footer - for this we want Cisco Copyright Information.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="document-body">Document Body</h3>

<p>The body of the document is found in the center panel and contains the main textual description of the API.  It uses a number of different elements and features to communicate what the API actually does and these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headers - these are titles of document section of which the H1 and H2 will automatically appear in the TOC</li>
<li>Paragraphs - these are simple paragraphs of text</li>
<li>Bold Text</li>
<li>Italicized Text</li>
<li>Inline Code Text</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Bullet Lists</li>
<li>Number Lists</li>
<li>Hints - These are Green Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Warnings - These are Red Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Notes - These are Blue Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Links - HTML hyperlinks to external documents</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="code-samples">Code Samples</h3>

<p>The key part of the DevNet Slate format for API documentation is that code samples can be viewed alongside of the API call that they illustrate.  Further sample code can be held simultaneously in several different programming languages (important for SOAP and REST API&rsquo;s).  Because programmers tend to only work in a single language at a time, the DevNet Slate format accommodates this by having the programming language as a tab on the far right panel.  Thus, the developer is able to choose a programming language and then use the documentation in that language without being distracted by any other language.</p>

<p>Sample code is anchored to either the H1 or H2 heading that they are inserted under; that is, they are placed under the Heading and will move up or down with the main text body. Code samples have the following elements that are used to control their placement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language - there is a tab for each language that is supported and specified in the header.<br></li>
<li>Code Annotations - these are highlighted areas that are not code but used to point out a code section.</li>
<li>Shared Code Samples - it is possible to make code that appears in all of the tabs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source document that is used to generate a DevNet Slate API Reference Manual is a GFM Document.  The GFM document is a plain text document that starts with headers that set variables that are used to control how the document is formatted. These items about the document and include:</p>

<h2 id="title-page">Title Page</h2>

<p>There are a number of variables that are used for display in the title page of the document.  The Title Page is displayed at the very top of the document is the text &ldquo;About this Document&rdquo; which is a link.  When the link is selected, the Title Page will open up and display information about the document from the variables in the header including:</p>

<ul>
<li>title_page: if set to <em>true</em> then the Title Page is turned on. </li>
<li>title: text string contains the name of the document and is used for both the Title Page and the &lt;title&gt; tag in the header of the page.</li>
<li>version: a text string used to display the current version of the document in both the Title Page and the TOC Footer if it is turned on.</li>
<li>copyright: a text string that contains the copyright statement for the document.  Copyright statements should contain the word &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo;, followed by the copyright symbol of &copy;, followed by the years that the work was first created and the year that it was last modified, and finished off with the phrase &ldquo;All Rights Reservered.&rdquo;</li>
<li>publisher: a text string that contains the Cisco Organization followed by &ldquo;, Cisco Systems, Inc.&rdquo;</li>
<li>publisher_address: a text string that contains the address of the publisher which should be &ldquo;Cisco Systems, Inc., 150 W Tasman Dr, San Jose, CA 95134, USA&rdquo;.</li>
<li>comments:  a free text string that allows the author to put in information about the document that will help the reader understand the context.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these values that are set for the Title Page, the date that the document was &ldquo;built&rdquo; is displayed at the bottom of the &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Published Date&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="turning-on-language-tabs">Turning on Language Tabs</h2>

<p>There is a <em>language_tab</em> statement for each language that will be on the tab in the Sample Code section of the the document.  The <em>language_tab</em> statement is followed by
one or more lines that contain a statement that contains two blank spaces, a dash, the name of the language for use in encoding the document, an option &ldquo;:&rdquo;, followed by an optional display name for the language.</p>

<p>The name of the language must be recognized by the system such that the display engine will automatically perform syntax highlighting on the code.  The engine supports lots of different languages but for Cisco documents, these are the standard values that we want to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>c++:C++</li>
<li>c#:C#</li>
<li>css:CSS</li>
<li>html:HTML</li>
<li>json:JSON</li>
<li>java:Java</li>
<li>javascript:JavaScript</li>
<li>markdown:GFM</li>
<li>objective-c:Objective-C</li>
<li>perl:Perl</li>
<li>php: PHP</li>
<li>puppet:Puppet</li>
<li>python:Python</li>
<li>ruby:Ruby</li>
<li>shell</li>
<li>xml:XML</li>
<li>yaml:YAML</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">
Only list the languages that you want to have as tabs in your document.  Each time you list a language as a _language_tab_, DevNet Slate will automatically create the language
tab regardless if that language is used in the document.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">

Please use the language tabs as stated above such that the Tabs are consistent between API&rsquo;s.

</aside>

<h1 id="creating-a-table-of-contents">Creating a Table of Contents</h1>

<p>The Table of Contents (ToC) appears in the far left panel of a document if it is turned on.  The ToC is automatically generated from the Headers found in your GFM source document but it is controlled by the values you set for directives in the headers of your documents.  If the ToC is enabled, then the headers that you designate using one or more <code class="prettyprint">#</code> characters are used to collect the entries of the ToC. </p>

<h2 id="toc-directives">ToC Directives</h2>

<p>There are a number of directives for controlling how the Table of Contents is presented.  These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>search: this true or false value will be used to turn on/off the search function.  The search function will only be enabled if the Table of Contents are turned on.</li>
<li>toc_selectors: this is a comma list of the document elements that will be selected for inclusion into the table of contents.  If the statement is missing, then the default value is &ldquo;h1, h2, h3&rdquo; which means that Headers 1, 2, and 3 will be included into the Table of Contents.  If you were to choose &ldquo;h2, h3, h4, h5&rdquo; then the first level headers would be ignored and only the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels will be selected for inclusion into the Table of Contents.</li>
<li>toc_footers: this is a bullet list of text that will appear at the bottom of the table of contents.  The footer statement is used to place text and links at the bottom of the Table of Contents.  In addition to the values that you specify, the version number (see the version directive above) will be included, followed by the values that you provide, and finally the date that the document was built.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">
Overtime, using the TOC footer to show copyright information will be deprecated for DevNet documents in favor of using the Title Page.
</aside>

<h2 id="turning-on-document-search">Turning on Document Search</h2>

<p>DevNet Slate has the option of providing readers with a local search.  When you insert the line <code class="prettyprint">search: true</code> into your header, the search option becomes enabled and a search box will appear in the Table of Contents right below the logo.</p>

<p>When a user types in text into the search box, the Table of Contents is automatically filtered to remove sections that do not contain the search term.  Text that matches the search term will be highlighted with a yellow background.</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-body-of-the-api-reference">Creating the Body of the API Reference</h1>

<h2 id="creating-headers">Creating Headers</h2>

<p>Headers are created by using one or more # characters starting in the first line of text within the GFM document. The sample to the right shows GFM that will result in a level 1, level 2, and level 3 headers.  Only the level 1 and level 2 headers will appear in the Table of Contents.  When you create sample code, it will anchor to a header.</p>

<p>On the right are a list of headers in markdown and below is how they will appear in the document:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Headings - Only H1 and H2 are shown in the TOC</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight markdown"><code>
<span class="gh"># H1 Header</span>
<span class="gu">## H2 Header</span>
<span class="gu">### H3 Header</span>
<span class="gu">#### H4 Header</span>
<span class="gu">#### H5 Header</span>
<span class="gu">#### H6 Header</span>

</code></pre>

<h1 id="h1-header">H1 Header</h1>

<h2 id="h2-header">H2 Header</h2>

<h3 id="h3-header">H3 Header</h3>

<h4 id="h4-header">H4 Header</h4>

<h4 id="h5-header">H5 Header</h4>

<h4 id="h6-header">H6 Header</h4>

<aside class="notice">
Remember that only level 1, 2, and 3 headers will appear in the Table of Contents by default and that this you can change this using the &ldquo;toc_selector&rdquo; directive.
</aside>

<h2 id="creating-a-paragraphs">Creating a Paragraphs</h2>

<p>For normal text, just type your paragraph on a single line.</p>

<p>This is some paragraph text. Exciting, no?</p>

<p>Make sure the lines above below your paragraph are empty.</p>

Just because you can, doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should.  One of the features of Markdown is that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the formatting details of HTML.  Also, it provides
a separation of content and format which you loose when you start placing HTML into your Markdown.

Row 1 col 1 | Row 1 col 2 | Row 1 col 3
Row 2 col 1 | Row 2 col 2 | Row 2 col 3
</code></pre>

<p>Slate uses PHP Markdown Extra style tables.  The example to the right will create the table below.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Table Header 1</th>
<th style="text-align: right">Table Header 2</th>
<th style="text-align: center">Table Header 3</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>

<p>Notice the colons in the line underneath the header line.  These are used align that columns of the table. A no colon or only a colon to the left will cause the column to align to the left.  A colon to the right will cause the column to align right.  And a colon to the left and the right will cause the column to center.</p>

<p>Numbered lists are created using the GFM markdown code to the right.  You can create nested lists, but the bullets are indented by two spaces.  The sample code to the right will create the list below:</p>

<ol>
<li>This</li>
<li>Is

<ol>
<li>Nested</li>
<li>Number</li>
<li>List</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An</li>
<li>Ordered</li>
<li>List</li>
</ol>

<aside class="notice"> Notice that the order of the numbers do not make a difference.  It is just that a number is used that makes an ordered list. </aside>

<aside class="notice"> Note that by indenting by two characters, you are creating an indented list and the numbering restarts and when you go back, the
numbering resumes.</aside>

## Creating Bulleted Lists

Numbered lists are created using the GFM markdown code to the right.  you can create nested lists, but the bullets are indented by two spaces.  The sample code
to the right will create the list below:

- This
+ Is
* A
  * nested
  - bullet

## Creating Special Notes and Warnings

> GFM for creating Notes and Warnings

&ldquo;`html
<aside class="notice"> This is a sample note. </aside>
    
<aside class="warning"> This is a sample warning.</aside>

<aside class="success"> This is a sample hint.</aside>
&rdquo;`

You can add little highlighted warnings and notes with just a little HTML embedded in your markdown document.  To the right, are three different examples of highlights using markdown.  Below you will see how each of the three examples will manifest themselves in the final document.

<aside class="notice"> This is a sample note. </aside>
    
<aside class="warning"> This is a sample warning.</aside>

<aside class="success"> This is a sample hint.</aside>

Use `class=&ldquo;notice&rdquo;` for blue notes, `class=&ldquo;warning&rdquo;` for red warnings, and `class=&ldquo;success&rdquo;` for green notes.

# Sample Code

> Sample GFM to Denote Sample Code

&ldquo;`markdown
    &rdquo;`python
    // this is some python code

Code samples are an important way of communicating how to use an API.  DevNet Slate does an excellent job of handling code samples in multiple languages simultaneously through the use of the tabbed sample code panel on the right hand side.

&ldquo;`

Sometimes you will need to insert a very large block of sample code that might be too wide or extremely deep.  DevNet Slate manages this by automatically creating vertical and horizontal scroll bars such that the sample code is preserved without taking up too much space.  The example to the right is an extremely large python program pulled from the Internet.  There is no wrapping of text, instead, your readers need to use horizontal scrolling to see the full code sample.  Also, it is very long, but a maximum height of 50 cm has been set for the display area.  If your sample code exceeds this, then DevNet Slate will also provide vertical scrolling such that the space is better managed. 

## Inserting a Sample Code into a Particular Tab

You denote a code samples by using three left-single-quote marks followed by the name of the language.  The name of the language is used to place the code sample into the proper tab. Each code samples will appear in the dark area to the right of the main text. Code samples need to appear right under the Level 1 or Level 2 headers in your markdown file to allow them to be anchored properly.

The &quot;language tabs&rdquo; are the tabs that appear in the upper right of DevNet Slate Documents. Users browsing the docs use them to select their programming language of choice.

In the sample GFM code to the right, the Ruby code will appear in the Ruby tab, while the Python code will appear in the Python tab. Because the DevNet Slate engine understands the syntax of most computer programming languages, the sample code will have its language syntax highlighted automatically in a way that would make sense to the developer.

But just because a language is used as sample code within a DevNet Slate document it does not mean that the tab will appear.  You tell the system which Language tabs you want to display by editing the `language-tabs` list at the top of your GFM source document.

<aside class="success"> Sometimes it is useful to share code between multiple tabs, you can do this by placing tagging the sample code using a language that is not used as a tab name.  For example if you tag sample code as `all` and `all` is not listed in the `language-tabs` then that sample code will appear in all of the tabs.</aside>

## Creating Code Sample Annotations

> Code Sample Annotations

&ldquo;`markdown
> This is a Code Annotation!
&rdquo;`
It is sometimes useful to highlight or annotate a part of the sample code.  This is done with code annotations.  By placing a > as the first character in your GFM line of text, you will create a code annotation that will appear in the area to the right, next to the code samples.

<aside class="warning"> Make sure that you have a blank line after your Code Annotation.  If you do not, the annotation will continue until there is a blank line.
</aside>

<h1 id="fun-with-the-right-hand-panel">Fun with the Right Hand Panel</h1>

<p>When you use the chevron <code class="prettyprint">&gt;</code> symbol, it takes the entire line and places it into the pannel to the right. Since it does not have a language, it will appear on all of the tabs to the right.  Additionally, because it is not &ldquo;code&rdquo; it is not treated as pre-formatted text.  As a result of these factors, the annotation feature can be very useful for placing Markdown or even HTML into the right hand panel.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">rake build</code> command tells Middleman to build your website to the <code class="prettyprint">build</code> directory of your project in a way that is Github compatible.  You then need to share those static HTML files with the DevNet team for publishing.  You can do this via Box.net or Dropbox.</p>

<h2 id="getting-your-document-on-devnet">Getting Your Document On DevNet</h2>

<p>Once you have built and tested your document using DevNet Slate, you can now get it publish it on DevNet.  You will need to raise a ticket to get your new static HTML files on DevNet for publishing.  You can do this by placing your build directory (with all subdirectories) into a zip, a Box.net folder or a Dropbox folder that you can share with the DevNet team. </p>

<h1 id="elements-of-style-for-cisco-apis-39">Elements of Style for Cisco APIs&rsquo;</h1>

<p>Now that you understand the mechanics of DevNet Slate.  Now we need to get into the specifics of how to use these tools to present a common, consistent, and great developer experience on DevNet for your API.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>Before we get into the specifics, let&rsquo;s deal with the high-level guidelines or ground rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Keep it Simple</em> - how you use English to communicate to developers is important.  One of the ways you can simplify things is to use person pronouns (e.g., you, we, us) as this approach will naturally simplify your English.</li>
<li><em>Tell Them How Not What</em> - It&rsquo;s possible to simply list all of your API calls, but this does not help the developer.  Instead, group your API end points into what they are used for.  For example, have headings that say &ldquo;Starting a New Discovery Job&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;The Post Discovery Method&rdquo;.</li>
<li><em>Use Examples</em> - this format is designed around code samples; use it!  Try to create an example for each of your API calls.</li>
<li><em>Test the Examples</em> - when you use an example, make sure that it works.</li>
<li><em>Use Graphics</em> - a picture is worth a thousand words.  The right graphic in the right place helps you to keep things simple.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="language-libraries">Language Libraries</h2>

<p>REST (or RESTful) APIs are becoming the standard.  Developers like using REST APIs because they are simple and universal.  Because REST APIs use HTTP protocol along with JSON or XML, it is easy to call a REST API from pretty much any programming language.  As a result, there is a natural tendency for the API engineer to think that language libraries (wrappers that make the REST call in the programming language of choice) is not needed. This is a fallacy.</p>

<p>A Programmer can call REST in a language like Python, Java, or C, with four to five lines of code.  When faced with this, the Programmer will typically write their own library of wrappers (code that encapsulates each REST end point) to make programming more module and cleaner.  Thus, if you want your API to be simple to use, you should have the wrappers for popular libraries built.  Next, you should use the language tabs of DevNet Slate to provide the syntax for each of the programming languages that you will be supporting.</p>
