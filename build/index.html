<p>DevNet is Cisco&rsquo;s Developer Program aimed a helping developers gain access to Cisco Technology such that they can build cool and exciting products.  Wether a developer is an IT
Professional working inside of a Cisco Customer&rsquo;s IT organization, a System Integrator, or a developer at an Independent Software Developer Program, Cisco DevNet is there to
help make your professional life easier.</p>

<p>Cisco has hundreds of product API&rsquo;s for developers.  We want to make it easy for you to find the API that you need to get your job done but we also want to make it easy
for you to use the API of choice.  To do this, we are providing a standard format for the documentation of API&rsquo;s with Cisco.</p>

<p>This document describes how an engineer or tech writer within Cisco would write an API reference manual for publication on DevNet.  The toolchain that we are using is based upon
Slate, the open source tool from TripIt, which in turn was inspired by the API Reference Manual published by Stripe.  Like many developers, we love the simple, elegant, yet
powerful way that Stripe documented their API.  In particular we loved how within the context of any given API call, you can choose a language and see sample code - we knew that
we were not alone and thus we chose to model our own documentation on this style.</p>

<p>Overtime, we have ideas on how we can update and modify this format to better suit the needs of the developer community and we are already planning those changes.  But for now,
we have this initial version.</p>

<h3 id="what-now?">What Now?</h3>

<h1 id="how-devnet-slate-works">How DevNet Slate Works</h1>

<p>Cisco&rsquo;s implementation of Slate is an HTML document generator that is written and executed in Ruby.  The software reads a source-file in Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is
used to generate an HTML API Reference Manual along with the accompanying Javascript and CSS files.  The Javascript and CSS files are simply included into the HTML that is generated
from the GFM File.</p>

<p>It all sounds simple, but it is a bit more complicated than that.  To get a consistent look and feel to Cisco API documentation, we want the authors of API Reference Manuals to
use the GFM tags in a particular way such that we get a common and consistent look and feel to Cisco API documents.  It is important to achive this cross-product consistency for if a
developer gets trained and used to on Cisco API Reference manual but now needs to use an API from another business unit, we want to leverage their experience and make the
cross training experience simple and pleasant.</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-a-devnet-slate-document">Structure of a DevNet Slate Document</h2>

<p>As you look at this document, you will notice that there are a couple of feature.  First, to the left is the Table of Contents area.  Next, in the center is the Body of the
document, and to the Right (in the dark area) are code examples.  Each of these elements have the following charateristics:</p>

<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>

<p>The TOC panel on the left hand side of the panel is composed of the following elements starting at the top and moving to the bottom:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Logo - this is generated from the logo held in the logo.png file held in the source directory.  We want to use this same Cisco Logo for all documents.</li>
<li>The Table of Contents - DevNet Slate only uses the first two level of headers in the Table of Contents.  By default, on the H1 is normally displayed.  If a user selects a H1 item, the TOC will expand to display the H2 items underneath it.  H3 and below are not displayed.</li>
<li>The TOC Footer - for this we want Cisco Copyright Information.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="document-body">Document Body</h3>

<p>The body of the document is found in the center panel and contains the main textual discription of the API.  It uses a number of different elements and features to communicate what the API
actually does and these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headers - these are titles of document section of which the H1 and H2 will automatically appear in the TOC</li>
<li>Paragraphs - these are simple paragraphs of text</li>
<li>Bold Text</li>
<li>Italicized Text</li>
<li>Inline Code Text</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Bullet Lists</li>
<li>Number Lists</li>
<li>Hints - These are Green Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Warnings - These are Red Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Notes - These are Blue Highlighted Text</li>
<li>Links - HTML hyperlinks to external documents</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="code-samples">Code Samples</h3>

<p>The key part of the DevNet Slate format for API documentation is that code samples can be viewed alongside of the API call that they illustrate.  Further sample code can be held
simultaneously in several different programming languages (important for SOAP and REST API&rsquo;s).  Because programmers tend to only
work in a single language at a time, the DevNet Slate format accomodates this by having the programming language as a tab on the far right panel.  Thus, the developer is able to
choose a programming language and then use the documentation in that language without being distracted by any other language.</p>

<p>Sample code are anchored to either the H1 or H2 heading that they are inserted under; that is, they are placed under the Heading and will move up or down with the main text body.
Code samples have the following elements that are used to control their placement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language - there is a tab for each language that is supported and specified in the header.<br></li>
<li>Code Annotations - these are highlighted areas that are not code but used to point out a code section.</li>
<li>Shared Code Samples - it is possible to make code that appears in all of the tabs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source document that is used to generate a DevNet Slate API Reference Manual is a GFM Document.  The GFM document is a plain text document that starts with headers that
set some items about the document and include:</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-document-title">Setting the Document Title</h2>

<p>This is just the name of the document and is a simple text string</p>

<h2 id="turning-on-language-tabs">Turning on Language Tabs</h2>

<p>There is a <em>language_tab</em> statement for each language that will be on the tab in the Sample Code section of the the document.  The <em>language_tab</em> statement is followed by
one or more lines that contain a statement that contains two blank spaces, a dash, the name of the languge for use in encoding the document, an option &ldquo;:&rdquo;, followed by an
optional display name for the language.</p>

<p>The name of the language must be recognized by the system such that the display engine will automatically perform syntax highlighting on the code.  The engine supports
lots of different languages but for Cisco documents, these are the standard values that we want to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>c++:C++</li>
<li>c#:C#</li>
<li>css:CSS</li>

<h1 id="creating-a-table-of-contents">Creating a Table of Contents</h1>

<p>The Table of Contents (ToC) of a document is automatically generated from the Headers found in your GFM source document.  In GFM, headers are denoted using one or more <code class="prettyprint">#</code> characters.
For DevNet Slate, only the first two levels of Headers will be written to the Table of Contents.  H1 Headers are found in the basic TOC while the H2 headers will pop up into the
display when the user scrolls down to that area.</p>

</span></pre>
<p>There are three ways to write links in GFM. Each is easier to read than the last.  The code to the right will generate the following:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an inline link to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
Here&rsquo;s a reference-style link to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
Here&rsquo;s a very readable link to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>.</p>

<p>The link definitions can appear anywhere in the document &ndash; before or after the place where you use them. The link definition names <a href="http://www.google.com/">1</a> and <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">yahoo</a> can be any unique string,
and are case-insensitive; <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">yahoo</a> is the same as <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">YAHOO</a>.</p>

<p>Notice the colons in the line underneath the header line.  These are used align that columns of the table. A no colon or only a colon to the left
will cause the column to align to the left.  A colon to the right will cause the column to align right.  And a colon to the left and the right

<p>Code samples are an important way of communicating how to use an API.  DevNet Slate does an excellent job of handling code samples in multiple languages simultaneously through the
use of the tabbed sample code panel on the right hand side.</p>

<h2 id="inserting-a-sample-code-into-a-particular-tab">Inserting a Sample Code into a Particular Tab</h2>

<p>You denote a code samples by using three left-single-quote marks followed by the name of the language.  The name of the languae is used to place the code sample into the proper tab.
Each code samples will appear in the dark area to the right of the main text. Code samples need to appear right under the Level 1 or Level 2 headers in your markdown file to
allow them to be anchored properly.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;language tabs&rdquo; are the tabs that appear in the upper right of DevNet Slate Documents. Users browsing the docs use them to select their programming language of choice.</p>

<p>In the sample GFM code to the right, the Ruby code will appear in the Ruby tab, while the Python code will appear in the Python tab. Because the DevNet Slate engine understands the
syntax of most computer programming languages, the sample code will have its language syntax hightlighted automatically in a way that would make sense to the developer.</p>

<p>But just because a language is used as sample code within a DevNet Slate document it does not mean that the tab will appear.  You tell the system which Language tabs you want to
display by editing the <code class="prettyprint">language-tabs</code> list at the top of your GFM source document.</p>

<p><aside class="success"> Sometimes it is useful to share code between multiple tabs, you can do this by placing tagging the sample code using a language that is not used as a
tab name.  For example if you tag sample code as <code class="prettyprint">all</code> and <code class="prettyprint">all</code> is not listed in the <code class="prettyprint">language-tabs</code> then that sample code will appear in all of the tabs.</aside></p>

you will create a code annotation that will appear in the area to the right, next to the code samples.</p>

<p><aside class="warning"> Make sure that you have a blank line after your Code Annoation.  If you do not, the annoation will continue until there is a blank line.

<p>It is pretty easy to preview your docs using your browser.</p>

<p>Start the test server using the command to the right.</p>

<p>You can now see the docs using your browser by going to the URL at <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567</a>. As you edit and save your source GFM document at <code class="prettyprint">source/index.md</code>,
your server should automatically update the document that you are previewing.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">rake build</code>. Middleman will build your website to the <code class="prettyprint">build</code> directory of your project.  You then need to share those static HTML files with the DevNet team
for publishing.  You can do this via Box.net or Dropbox.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-your-docs-to-github-pages">Publishing Your Docs to Github Pages</h2>

<p>Publishing your API documentation on Github couldn&rsquo;t be more simple.</p>

<ol>
<li>Commit your changes to the markdown source: <code class="prettyprint">git commit -a -m &quot;Update index.md&quot;</code></li>
<li>Push the <em>markdown source</em> changes to Github: <code class="prettyprint">git push</code></li>
<li>Compile to HTML, and push the HTML to Github pages: <code class="prettyprint">rake publish</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Done! Your changes should now be live on http://yourusername.github.io/slate, and the main branch should be updated with your edited markdown. Note that if this is your first time publishing Slate, it can sometimes take ten minutes or so before your content is available online.</p>

<p><aside class="warning"> When you publish a document to Github, this document becomes public and available for others to edit.  This might be what you and the Cisco Business Unit
wants to do, but make sure that it is before you publish.

<p>Now that you understand the mechanics of DevNet Slate.  Now we need to get into the specifics of how to use these tools.  Our goal is to present a common and consistent
developer experience on DevNet and a big part of this is how we document an API.</p>

<p>Below are a number examples of how we have used the DevNet Slate tools to solve problems to communicate API information.</p>
