# Introduction 

dpSlate is an HTML authoring tool that help authors more effectively communicate to an audience.  Originally designed specifically to author API reference manuals, it has been expanded to create a much wider selection of documents.  As a result of enhancements to dpSlate, it can now be used to create many different types of documents including:

* Overviews
* Getting Started Guides
* Tutorials
* Technical Reference Manuals
* Sample Apps

To accommodate the need to deal with different types of documents, dpSlate allows the document author to control the structure of how the document will be formatted.  dpSlate can have up to three different panels that the author can turn on or off as required by the type of document:

* _Left Hand Panel_ - used for document meta-data such as a title page, document search, and table of contents.

* _Center Panel_ - used for the contents of the document.

* _Right Hand Panel_ used for code samples and other technical reference materials.

This document describes how an engineer or tech writer can use dpSlate to publish technical materials on a developer portal powered by dpEngine.  

## Document with Left and Right Panel Turned On

> dpSlate Document with all three panels on

> ![dpSlate with Three Panels](/images/dpslate/threePanel.png)

When all three panels are turned on, the dpSlate document will look as shown.  The three panels are for the document meta-data (left), body of the document, and supporting materials to the right.

## Document with Right Panel Turned Off

> dpSlate Document with two panels on

> ![dpSlate with Two Panels](/images/dpslate/twoPanel.png)


When the right panel is turned off, the supporting materials that were in the right hand panel are not brought into the center panel at the appropriate place.  The left hand panel is not imacted.

## Document with the Left Panel Turned Off

> dpSlate Document with one panel on

> ![dpSlate with One Panels](/images/dpslate/onePanel.png).

Finally, when the left hand panel is turned off, the document becomes a single column document with the meta-data at the top and the body of the document below.
