# dpSlate Regression Test

This file contains a number of test cases for performing regression testing on dpSlate.  Each test case is its own subdirectory in the source directory of `/dpSlateTests`.  The directories should have meaningful names as the directory names are used to distinguish the test cases.  In each test case subdirectory there should be an index file to execute the test.  The extension of the file should be set depending upon the type of test that is being run.  

There is no need to modify this file.  Any subdirectory will automatically be included onto this page as this page is Embedded Ruby and it loops through the directories building a header and paragraph for each test.  As such this page is also a test.  

# Success Criteria

- This page should be displayed in the two column format - there is no right hand column.
- The page should have a collapsable title page on the left.
- The page should have a table of contents to the left.
- The test cases should be generated as `<h2>` below
- Each test case should appear in the Table of Contents
- The Table of Contents should be fully expanded for the Test Cases (not accordian mode).
- Each test case should have a link that goes to the test case page.

# Test Cases

Below are links to each of the test cases that are located in sub-directories of `/source/dpSlateTests/`.
    
<% Dir.foreach("source/dpSlateTests/") do |file| next if file[0] == '.' or file == 'index.md.erb' %>
  <% url = config[:http_prefix] + 'dpSlateTests/' + file %>
